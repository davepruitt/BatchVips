# BatchVips
This program does a batch run of the VIPS program to convert TIF images to DeepZoom format. It was developed as a support program to the PRV Cell Counting application (found here: https://github.com/davepruitt/PRV-Cell-Counting). It is not necessary for the PRV Cell Counting application to run. This program facilitates converting large numbers of TIF images into the Microsoft DeepZoom format by calling the VIPS image conversion tool for each image.

If you want to adapt this program, you must first install VIPS. You must then edit the code of this program to point to the folder where your installation of VIPS is found. After doing so, this program should do quite well at converting a batch of TIF images to DeepZoom format. You can leave your desk and go get lunch.
